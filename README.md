# ✊🏽 BLM Tweet Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of 360 tweets related to the Black Lives Matter movement. 

I used OpenAI API GPT calls to categorize tweet sentiments. The results are visualized through bar graphs and word clouds, offering an engaging overview of sentiment trends and key themes. 

This project serves as a foundation for visualizing tweet data and, with additional data refinement, aims to uncover further insights into this significant and transformative period.
