Hello 
Considering the original list contains only four categories: 'Medium', 'Low', 'High' and 'Unknown', breaking them down into 20 categories does not directly make sense without providing some extra metric or dimension along which these messages can be classified. 

However, if you're asking for examples of general categories you could use to sort your tweets, this could be achieved with numerous factors. Here are 20 possible categories you could use, based on various characteristics a tweet might have:

1. Positive Sentiment
2. Negative Sentiment
3. Neutral Sentiment
4. Highly Popular (many retweets/favorites)
5. Unpopular (few retweets/favorites)
6. Mentions of Brands/Products
7. Contains Images/Videos
8. Link Sharing
9. User Engagement (Responses to or mentions of other users)
10. Hashtags
11. Location Based Tweets
12. Relevant to Current Events/News
13. Spam or Unwanted Content
14. Inspirational Content or Quotes
15. Personal Updates or Comments
16. Asking a Question or Seeking Advice
17. Humor or Memes
18. Retweets
19. Endorsement or Promotion of Products/Services
20. Unknown (Can't be classified into the above categories)

This categorization is rather general though, and may not fit every possible tweet. An ideal categorization will largely dependent on the nature/type of tweets that are being produced, necessitating a more custom approach if a perfect fit is required.
